Authentication

Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To start using the API, you need first to get a token.

To get a token, we are not using traditional email/password registration processes, we use a new authentication method: a cryptographically-secure login flow using the MetaMask extension or web3 library.
The basic idea is that itâ€™s cryptographically easy to prove the ownership of an account by signing a piece of data using a private key.

First you need to get a `nonce` for your ethereum address (GET request)::

    https://api.neoplace.io/api/subscribe/address?publicAddress={{ethereum_address}}

Response::

    {
        "publicAddress":"{{ethereum_address}}",
        "nonce":"xxxxxxxx"
    }

If you have received an empty response, you must signup before (POST request)::

    curl --request POST \
      --url "https://api.neoplace.io/api/subscribe/signup" \
      --data '{
      "publicAddress": "{{ethereum_address}}",
    }'

Then you can redo the identification process.

Sign the message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you receive the `nonce` in the response from the API call above, sign the message with your private key by running the following code (web3 library required)::

    web3.personal.sign(web3.fromUtf8(`Log in NeoPlace (nonce: ${nonce})`), web3.eth.coinbase, console.log);

Obtain authentication token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you signed the message with your private key, make another API call with with both ethereum address and signature (curl method or equivalent, POST request)::

    curl --request POST \
        --url 'https://api.neoplace.io/login' \
        --data '{
            "pubKey": "{{ethereum_address}}",
            "signature": "{{signed_message}}"
        }'

The authentication API verifies that your signed message complies with your public address, if it successes, your will receive your authentication in the Response headers::

    Authorization: Bearer {{token_generated}}

Then the token needs to be included in the request header following RFC 2617::

    Authorization: Bearer {{token_generated}}
